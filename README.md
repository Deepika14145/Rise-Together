# Rise-Together

The problem: Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. The social and economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic has made the situation even bleaker. Progress in many areas, including time spent on unpaid care and domestic work, and gender-responsive budgeting, is falling behind.

The challenge: To enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women.
